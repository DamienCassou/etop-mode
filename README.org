* etop
- view top in an emacs buffer
- operate on pids via standard bindings (evil bindings available via etop-evil)
- pause refresh rate to act upon pids, resume to continue to monitor processes
- pull requests welcome

** TODO:
   - syntax highlighting of buffer
   - custom refresh rate
   - etc.
     
** Usage:
   - M-x etop
   - pause buffer via M-x etop-pause or keybind
   - operate on pid via keybind: strace, kill or renice
   - resume or kill *etop* buffer

most of this code is reused from Benjamin Rutt's top.el on the emacs wiki, it has been refreshed
and I'm in the process of improving bits and pieces of it.
